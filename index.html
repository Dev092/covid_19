    <h1>Covid 19 Pandemic in India</h1>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

     <p>The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020.India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia. As of May 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with nearly 20 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and 242,362 deaths as of 8 May 2021.

        The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan. Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time. Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases. Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.
        
        A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much larger than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in parts of the country. By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period. Experts believe that India's figures are vastly underreported due to poor infrastructure, low testing rates, and people dying at home.
        
        India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021, and by April was administering 4 million doses a day.[19] India has authorised the British Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield), the Indian BBV152 (Covaxin) vaccine, and the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use. As of 1 May 2021, less than 2 percent of the population has been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021.On 19 January 2021, nearly a year after the first reported case in the country, Lakshadweep became the last region of India to report its first case. By February 2021, daily cases had fallen to 9,000 per-day. However, by early-April 2021, a major second wave of infections took hold in the country; on 9 April, India surpassed 1 million active cases,and on 12 April, India overtook Brazil as having the second-most COVID-19 cases worldwide, behind only the United States.

            Multiple factors have been cited as having potentially contributed to the sudden spike in cases, including highly-infectious variants of concern such as Lineage a lack of preparations (temporary hospitals were often dismantled after cases started to decline, and new facilities were not built), and health and safety precautions being poorly-implemented or enforced during festivals (such as Holi on 29 March, and the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in April),sporting events (such as IPL), state and local elections in several states, and in public places. An economic slowdown put pressure on the government to lift restrictions, and there had been a feeling of exceptionalism based on the hope that India's young population and childhood immunisation scheme would blunt the impact of the virus. Models may have underestimated projected cases and deaths due to the under-reporting of cases in the country.
            
            The Haridwar Kumbh Mela was linked to at least 1,700 positive cases between 10 and 14 April alone, and 68 cases among Hindu seers between 5-14 April. Politicians and activists, including Prime Minister Modi, have been criticised for holding rallies during the pandemic.Due to high demand, the vaccination programme began to be hit with supply issues; exports of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine were suspended in order to meet domestic demand, there have been shortages of the raw materials required to manufacture vaccines domestically, while hesitancy and a lack of knowledge among poorer, rural communities has also impacted the programme.
            
            By late April, India passed 2.5 million active cases and was reporting an average of 300,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths per-day. Some analysts feared this was an undercount; epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee has estimated that the actual death toll of the pandemic in India may be two to five times higher than the official totals. On 26 April, India reported 350,000 new cases and over 2,800 deaths in one day.On 30 April, India reported over 400,000 new cases and over 3,500 deaths in one day.
            
            The second wave placed a major strain on the healthcare system, including an ongoing shortage of liquid medical oxygen due to unanticipated demand, delays in transport, and a lack of cryogenic tankers. On 21 April, 22 COVID-19 patients who required ventilators died at a hospital in Maharashtra after an accident caused a leak in its main oxygen supply. On 23 April, Modi met via videoconference with liquid oxygen suppliers, where he acknowledged the need to "provide solutions in a very short time", and acknowledged efforts such as increases in production, and the use of rail (with the Indian Railways transporting tankers via "Oxygen Express" trains)[80] and air transport to deliver oxygen supplies. On 25 April, the PM CARES Fund announced that it would allocate funding to install 551 oxygen plants using pressure swing adsorption at public health facilities.
            
            A number of countries announced that they would provide emergency aid to India. European Union member states announced that they would send oxygen supplies, medicines and ventilators through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The United Kingdom planned to send oxygen concentrators and additional ventilators. Following political pressure, the United States offered to provide personal protective equipment and to lift export controls on vaccines and their materials in order to send raw materials for producing the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. This was the first time in 16 years that India started accepting gifts, donations and aid from foreign nations, including China. Head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Anthony Fauci stated that the country had not ruled out sending supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine—which has not yet been approved in the U.S.—to India</p>
